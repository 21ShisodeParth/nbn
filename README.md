DIGHUM 100, a class that bridges the digital humanities and programming techniques, led me and my team to conduct a research project tackling the following questions:

1. How has song length changed over time?
2. Where are artists whose songs are featured in the dataset primarily from?
3. What is the relationship between a song's genre and its BPM?
4. What is the relationship between a song's genre and its key?
5. What are some of the most popular genres included  within this dataset?
6. How has genre popularity changed over time? (Seen on this page below)
